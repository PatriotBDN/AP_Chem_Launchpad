    <h3>Message to the Users</h3>

      <p> Yes, we all know how much of a pain this class is because the teacher does
      not teach so I have taken it upon myself to make summaries of each section,
      with definitions and help with solving the Equations. If you are in the class
      send me your school email and I will add you to the suggestions list so you can
      help proof-read and add to the documents in the respective section. I will have
      sections for the reading quizzes, summaries, example equations, powerpoints and
      anything I can find that is helpful. We will have a section soon for people who
      want to apply to help with the website but just contributing the information would
      be phenominal. I will leave my contact info below to get in touch with me if you
      have any questions.
